2 - Convert the map into a World file with MAT format (see https://github.com/mkhayatian/Matlab-Simulator-for-RSS-based-motion-planning-of-Connected-Autonomous-Vehicles/blob/V2/CityWide/osm/osm-converter-master/README.MD)

3 - inside the CityWide folder, open main.m and run.

4 - to change the map, you need to replace the World3.mat (default)
